# Swift vs Rust pattern matching

Hey everybody! It’s #2 record in the iOS dev on the Rust journey journal. 
Today we’re gonna talk about pattern matching. Both Swift and Rust are modern languages that have lots of syntax sugar to make our lives sweeter. 

I came to Swift after C# and Obj-C when it was still young and unstable language. But even back then if-let, guard-let, switch and enums with associated values were revolutionary to me. I still find Swift super fun language to work with, so let’s take a look at what we have in Rust, is it the same fun?

## Basic switch / match

When we have some value and we want to go through our options we can do something basic like this:

```Swift
let value = 2
switch value {
case 1:
  print("One")
case 2:
  print("Two")
default:
  print("Something else \(valule)")
}
```
